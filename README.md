Hi there! I'm Ananya, a graduate student with a passion for using data to drive insights and solve complex problems.

Throughout my academic journey, I've gained hands-on experience with a variety of data science techniques, including statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. I'm particularly interested in applying these skills to real-world challenges, such as optimizing marketing campaigns or developing predictive models for healthcare outcomes.

When I'm not digging into data sets, you can find me binge-reading books, trying out new recipes or watching Formula 1 highlights. I'm always eager to learn and collaborate with others in and outside the field, so feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about anything!

Thanks for stopping by, and I look forward to connecting with you.
